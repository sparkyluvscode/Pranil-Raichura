  about: {
    service: "Service is about getting out in your community to take risks, even if you are nervous at first. I've learned this through volunteering projects and experience over time, as I often had to step out of my comfort zone to make a difference; whether it was standing on the stage in front of many seniors, helping them navigate the world of technology, or holding a certificate and speaking about the effects of our clothes drive on local families at a high school in front of a crowd at Rancho Cordova's City Hall.",
    techPassion: "Ever since I was young, I have always been interested in the nuances of technology, from the intricate instruments that handle an A320 passenger aircraft to the differences between operating systems in the Samsung S24 Ultra and the iPhone 15. This drove me to try to learn programming in the fall of 2021, where over time I've learned Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and C#. Python is my main focus as I regularly use multithreading, algorithms, and sockets to manage data and connections.",
    goals: "While I have a lot of goals in high school, such as reaching the Platinum Division in the USA Computing Olympiad, trying my best in school, and making friends along the way, my main goal is to complete a passion project of developing a serious game honed towards improving behavior and emotional patterns of kids with ASD and writing a research paper on it.",
